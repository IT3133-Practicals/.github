### üöÄ **Getting Started with React or React Native**

1. **For React Web Projects**:
   After cloning the repository and navigating to the project folder, install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   To run the React web application, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will launch the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

2. **For React Native Projects**:
   If you're working on React Native projects, first install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   For running React Native on your device or emulator, use the following command:

   ```bash
   npx react-native run-android  # For Android
   npx react-native run-ios      # For iOS (if you are on macOS)
   ```

   Alternatively, you can use [Expo](https://expo.dev/) for running React Native apps:

   ```bash
   npm install -g expo-cli
   expo start
   ```

   This will open the Expo DevTools in your browser, where you can scan the QR code to run the app on your mobile device.
